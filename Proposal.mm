<node CREATED="1234555620343" ID="Freemind_Link_1722750001" MODIFIED="1234805629568" TEXT="Quantum mechanics provides us with the ability to do things that go beyond what the classical world has to offer us.  For example, a quantum computer can allow us to solve problems that are believed to be intractable by a classical computer, and superconductivity (a quantum phenomenon) allows us to transport electrical energy losslessly over a long distance and also to create strong magnetic fields.  The key to being able to harness these phenomena is to be able to understand how we can create the existence of &quot;quantum coherence&quot; on a macroscopic scale.&#xa;&#xa;Towards this end, my proposed Practicum project would focus on a small piece of this grander puzzle by investigating the properties of cold atoms trapped in various potentials in order to understand more about macroscopic quantum coherences present in the flow of atoms around the trap.  Specifically, two questions would be addressed:&#xa;&#xa;First, under what conditions does a macroscopic coherent quantum state emerge in this setting?  In particular, towards this end, I would start by examining the difference between states generated by attractive versus repulsive couplings between the atoms.&#xa;&#xa;Second, how do impurities couple through the condensate?  Of particular interest is investigating to what extent we might be able the impurities as quantum bits with the condensate acting as a &quot;bus&quot; which allows them to communicate.&#xa;&#xa;The reason why these questions are good candidates for computational analysis is that they involve systems that are highly coupled, and thus standard techniques (Gross-Pitaevski) which assume weak coupling are not as effective in these systems.  The particular technique that I would use (or at least, that I would start by using) is the variational path integral approach, which uses methods built on Monte Carlo sampling to compute a representation of the ground state of a quantum system.  Since I would be interested in studying excited states, however, I would also have to use a &quot;trick&quot; of imposing a fixed phase (velocity) on the flow so that this approach converges to the state I want rather than the ground state.  Fortunately, much of the code needed to implement this approach has already been written, allowing me to spend more of my time focusing on science rather than code development.&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;"/>

<node CREATED="1234557951518" ID="Freemind_Link_1047697940" MODIFIED="1234805812191" TEXT="The proposed practicum work provides a very good complement to my thesis work in several ways.&#xa;&#xa;First, the systems that I have been studying have completely discrete degrees of freedom -- coming from the fact that they are models of systems of quantum bits.  This project would give me experience with modeling continuous systems.&#xa;&#xa;Second, the systems I have been geared towards studying have been relatively simple models of reality as a first step toward understanding more complex variants of these systems.  This project would let me take a break from this by having me focus on a different class of systems that can be simulated more realistically -- enough so that the models accurately represent systems that can be constructed by experimentalists;  indeed, we will be in contact with experimentalists at LANL to see if we can tweak our models to give predictions that they can test.&#xa;&#xa;Third, most of the focus on my thesis research up until now has been on improving methods for simulating quantum systems, rather than performing actually simulations myself to learn new things;  although the eventual goal is to simulate and learn more about some systems that are currently out of reach, much more development of code and methods needs to be done before I can tackle them.  This project would offer me a refreshing break from this by giving me an opportunity to apply existing techniques to learn more about physical systems, rather than focusing on improving the simulation techniques themselves.&#xa;&#xa;Finally, this project would give me experience in working with Quantum Monte Carlo techniques.  Although they have some significant limitations -- which is the inspiration behind my primary thesis research into a class of alternative simulation techniques -- they are nonetheless widely used and highly effective in many regimes and so it would be very useful for me to having working experience with them.&#xa;&#xa;So in short, this project would allow me to do research in the same general theme as my thesis research -- simulations of strongly couple quantum systems -- but on the opposite end of the spectrum, so to speak, which would greatly broaden my research experience."/>
